Tiny habits which when consistently done can change our bigger habits in course of time. We need to develope our own tiny habits which we can apply to achieve our own goals. Speaker talked about how he lost waight
in course of months applying tiny habbits like doing two push ups every time he went to pee.

**2.How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.**

In B = MAP , M is motivation to do the task, A is Abiltiy to do the task at that time and P is the prompt to do the task. I can use the above formula by integrating small habits and making them action prompt to continue the momentum. Celebrating small wins to keep the motivation will help in continuing with these small habits.


**3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)**

Shine as the speaker says is a feeling when we get success in something we worked hard for and for a long time. We sould apply the same thing to our sucesses in small habits also.

**4. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

Habits good or bad compound over time. Good habits can be build only when we have a plan to do it and not just motivation as it can lower with time. Environment also plays a key role in developing better habits as when they are presented to them as option. 

A good story speaker shared was a study in a place when they replaced most of soda machines with water and with time people startedto choose water more than soda.

**5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?**

The book says that habits are not outcome of identity but its the identity that is the outcome of habit. Over time our good or habits starts to define our identity of how as person we are.

**6. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?**

Creating an environment making good habits easier to do and bad habit harder can help in adopting better habits over time. Like if we want to read a book the we should put it near to where we sit so that it is in our range of view. 

**7. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?**

Working to get a goal rather than behaviour can make habit harder to do. Improving behaviour over time is much more beneficial than just focusing on the goal.

**8. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?**

Work towards getting more work done with less procastination. For this I would like to sround myselfs with ques to learn and do a task better.


**9. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?**

Living unhealthy life is something I would like to eliminate. 

Avoiding unhealthy habit. Trying to excercise more often and involve my self with sports so as to make it more fun
