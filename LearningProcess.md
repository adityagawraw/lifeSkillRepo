**1. What is the Feynman Technique?**

Learning a topic is complete when you can explain that topic to someone in simple plan words.

**2. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

Learning a concept requries constant breaks in between sessions. This is required to keep the flow going and not get stuck at something
for too long.

**3. What are active and diffused modes of thinking?**

As Barbara Oakely described while trying to get new ideas about something our brain is constantly shifting between two states. One is active mode in which brain is focused .other is diffused in which brain is less focused but can link thoughts/points further away from the topic. This can be helpful if we are stuck at somthing. 

**4. According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.**

  * Learning a topic requires applying it. 
  * You have to learn just enough so that you can apply that technique and you will find gaps in it.
  * Work on the gaps and see how you are improving. Learn more if required.  

**5. What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?**

*  Learning using Feynman Technique.
*  Taking rest in between learning sessions.
*  At start learn just enough so that you can apply it and then continue the process.
