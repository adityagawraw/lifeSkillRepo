**1. Which point(s) were new to you?**

* Gathering requirements of the project for better clarity of the path. Making notes while in meeting with the client or manager.
* Sharing the notes to get feedback so that to confirm that both are on the same track.
* Over-communicating urgent scenarios like change in requirements, problems with hardware, implementation issues, etc.
* Using the group chat instead of DMs to communicate.  

**2. Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?**

* Doing things with full focus. Keep phone in silent mode and only keep work related notifications while working
* Be aware of other people's work and only schedule meetings at their free time.
* Get to know my team members. Joining meetings a bit early.
* Ask questions if stuck. Message the all the things related to the problem in detail in one message and don't do multiple messages.
 Also, share what ideas on which I worked on.
